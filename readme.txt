Streamline accessibility improvements for your WordPress site with tools for alt text editing, focus management, keyboard navigation, and more — all from your admin dashboard.

== Description ==
**Accessibility Toolkit** provides practical accessibility enhancements for WordPress admins, content editors, and developers. Designed to help you meet WCAG compliance faster, it includes focused tools for common a11y tasks — right where you need them.

**Features:**

- **Alt Text Column & Inline Editing:** Adds a sortable “Alt Text” column to the Media Library list view, including an edit button for quickly updating missing or incorrect image alt text.
- **Image Metadata Columns:** Adds sortable columns for image dimensions, MIME type (e.g. `image/png`, `application/zip`), and file size.
- **WCAG-Oriented Enhancements (coming soon):**
  - Skip link injector
  - Heading structure audit
  - Color contrast checker
  - ARIA role validator
- **AJAX Editing:** Inline alt text edits update instantly without reloading the page.
- **Accessibility-First Focus:** Designed to complement your accessibility audit process and help non-technical users contribute to site compliance.

This plugin is ideal for accessibility-conscious site owners, developers, and content managers looking for tools to bridge the compliance gap.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/accessibility-toolkit/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit the Media Library list view to see the new accessibility columns and editing tools.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin automatically make my site accessible? =
No — Accessibility Toolkit is not a one-click solution. It provides tools that help you identify and resolve common accessibility issues more efficiently, particularly in the WordPress admin area.

= Can I edit alt text in bulk? =
Currently, you can quickly edit alt text one-by-one directly in the Media Library table. A bulk editor is planned for a future release.

= Does it detect decorative images? =
Not yet, but future versions will include a toggle to mark images as decorative by setting empty alt text and/or ARIA roles.

= Will more accessibility tools be added? =
Yes. This plugin is being actively developed. Planned features include a heading audit tool, skip link injector, focus visualizer, and contrast checker.

= Where can I request features and get further support? =
We recommend using our [website support forum](https://pluginrx.com/support/plugin/accessibility-toolkit/) as the primary method for requesting features and getting help. You can also reach out via our [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/3HnzNEJVnR) or the [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/accessibility-toolkit/), but please note that WordPress.org doesn’t always notify us of new posts, so it’s not ideal for time-sensitive issues.
